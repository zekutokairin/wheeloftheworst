Lets you create your own WOTW within SuperVHS!

Just point it at a directory full of movies, and it will pick a number,
and insert them into SuperVHS to play on the Plinkett TV.

TODO:
- Create a backup of all the videos
- Check to see if we can use Windows soft links or symlinks for videos

Future:
- Scan for likely locations of SuperVHS
- Uninstall option to restore videos to stock settings
